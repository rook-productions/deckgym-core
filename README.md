# deckgym-core: Pokémon TCG Pocket Simulator

![Card Implemented](https://img.shields.io/badge/Cards_Implemented-3340_%2F_3761_%2888.8%25%29-green)

**deckgym-core** is a high-performance Rust library designed for simulating Pokémon TCG Pocket games. It features a command-line interface (CLI) capable of running 10,000 simulations in approximately 3 seconds. This is the library that powers https://www.deckgym.com.

Its mission is to elevate the competitive TCG Pocket scene by helping players optimize their decks through large-scale simulations.

## Usage

The CLI runs simulations between two decks in DeckGym Format. To create these files, build your decks in https://www.deckgym.com/builder, select **Share** > **Copy as Text**, and save the content as a text file.

We already provide several example decks in the repo you can use to get started. For example, to face off a VenusaurEx-ExeggutorEx deck with a Weezing-Arbok deck 1,000 times, run:

```bash
cargo run simulate example_decks/venusaur-exeggutor.txt example_decks/weezing-arbok.txt --num 1000 -v
```

You can also simulate one deck against multiple decks in a folder. The total games will be distributed evenly across all decks:

```bash
# Simulate your deck against all decks in example_decks folder (1000 games total)
cargo run simulate my_deck.txt example_decks/ --num 1000 -v
```

## Terminal User Interface (TUI)

The TUI provides an interactive way to view and replay games with a visual representation of the game state.

To use the TUI, you need to enable the `tui` feature:

```bash
cargo run --bin tui --features tui -- example_decks/venusaur-exeggutor.txt example_decks/weezing-arbok.txt --players e,e
```

### Controls

- **↑/↓/Space**: Navigate between game states (forward/backward)
- **PageUp/PageDown**: Scroll through battle log
- **A/D**: Scroll through your hand cards
- **Shift+A/Shift+D**: Scroll through opponent's hand cards
- **Q/Esc**: Quit

## Data Export

The simulator can export (state, action) pairs during gameplay for machine learning and data analysis applications. This feature outputs portable JSON files that are easy to consume from any programming language.

### Usage

Use the `--data-output` flag to specify an output folder:

```bash
cargo run -- simulate example_decks/fire.txt example_decks/flareon.txt \
  -n 1000 \
  --players r,r \
  --data-output ./exported_data
```

### Output Structure

The data is organized as:
```
exported_data/
├── <game_id_1>/
│   ├── ply_0000.json
│   ├── ply_0001.json
│   └── ...
├── <game_id_2>/
│   ├── ply_0000.json
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

Each JSON file contains:
- `game_id`: UUID of the game
- `ply`: Sequential decision point number
- `actor`: Which player (0 or 1) made the decision
- `state`: Complete game state (hands, decks, in-play Pokemon, etc.)
- `playable_actions`: All available actions at this decision point
- `chosen_action`: The action that was actually taken

### Processing the Data

A Python example is included to demonstrate data loading and feature extraction:

```bash
python examples/load_exported_data.py ./exported_data
```

The JSON format makes it easy to:
- Train policy networks (predict actions from states)
- Train value networks (estimate win probability)
- Perform imitation learning
- Build custom machine learning models
- Analyze gameplay patterns and statistics

## Contributing

New to Open Source? See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

The main contribution is to implement more cards, basically their attack and abilities logic. This makes the cards eligible for simulation and thus available for use in https://www.deckgym.com.

See the Claude [SKILL.md](./.claude/skills/implement-cards/SKILL.md) describing how to implement cards.
It's good documentation for humans and AIs alike.


## Appendix: Useful Commands

Once you have Rust installed (see https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) you should be able to use the following commands from the root of the repo:

**Running Automated Test Suite**

```bash
cargo test --features "tui test-utils"
```

**Running Benchmarks**

```bash
cargo bench --features test-utils
```

**Running Main Script**

```bash
# Simulate between two specific decks
cargo run simulate example_decks/venusaur-exeggutor.txt example_decks/weezing-arbok.txt --num 1000 --players r,r
cargo run simulate example_decks/venusaur-exeggutor.txt example_decks/weezing-arbok.txt --num 1 --players r,r -vv
cargo run simulate example_decks/venusaur-exeggutor.txt example_decks/weezing-arbok.txt --num 1 --players r,r -vvvv

# Simulate one deck against all decks in a folder (games distributed evenly)
cargo run simulate example_decks/venusaur-exeggutor.txt example_decks/ --num 1000 --players r,r -v

# Optimize incomplete decks
cargo run optimize example_decks/incomplete-chari.txt A2147,A2148 example_decks/ --num 10 --players e,e -v
cargo run optimize example_decks/incomplete-chari.txt A2147,A2147,A2148,A2148 example_decks/ --num 1000 --players r,r -v --parallel
```

**Player Codes**

`--players` takes two comma-separated codes, one per seat.

| Code | Player |
|---|---|
| `r` | uniformly random legal action |
| `w` | weighted random |
| `aa` | attach energy, then attack |
| `et` | end the turn immediately |
| `er` | evolution rusher |
| `v` | one-ply greedy on the baseline value function |
| `m` | MCTS, 100 iterations |
| `h` | human (TUI only) |
| `e`, `e<depth>` | ExpectiMiniMax over its own turn, default depth 3 |
| `o`, `o<depth>`, `ok<K>`, `o<depth>k<K>` | opponent-aware search, default depth 3 and K 3 |

`o` is the only code that looks past the end of its own turn. It searches its own actions the way
`e` does, then, at every end-of-turn position, samples `K` determinisations of the opponent's
hidden hand (drawn from the cards the opponent has not revealed, never from their real hand), lets
the opponent take a full reply turn under a fast greedy policy, and averages the value of what is
left. `o` is `o3k3`; `o2` is a cheaper depth, `ok5` samples more opponent hands, `o2k5` sets both.
It is expensive. On venusaur-exeggutor against weezing-arbok, 50 games with `--parallel` on a
16-core M4 Max (shared with other work, so these are upper bounds): `e,e` 0.045 to 0.049 s per game,
`o2,e` 0.46 to 0.52 s per game, `o,e` 1.05 to 1.31 s per game. That is roughly 21x `e` at depth 3
and 9x at depth 2. Always pass `--parallel`, and reach for `o2` when the game count matters.

```bash
cargo run --release -- simulate example_decks/venusaur-exeggutor.txt example_decks/weezing-arbok.txt --num 50 --players o,e --parallel
```

**Card Search Tool**

The repository includes a search utility that's particularly useful for agentic AI applications, as reading the complete `database.json` file (which contains all card data) often exceeds context limits.

```bash
# Search for cards by name
cargo run --bin search "Charizard"

# Search for cards with specific attacks
cargo run --bin search "Venusaur" --attack "Giant Bloom"
```

**Card Implementation Status Tool**

Check which cards are fully implemented versus which are missing attack effects, abilities, or trainer logic. This tool helps contributors identify cards that need implementation work.

```bash
# Show all cards with their implementation status
cargo run --bin card_status

# Show only incomplete cards
cargo run --bin card_status -- --incomplete-only

# Get the first incomplete card (useful for automation)
cargo run --bin card_status -- --first-incomplete
```

The tool displays a summary showing total cards, completion percentage, and a breakdown of missing implementations by type (attacks, abilities, tools, trainer logic).

**Temporary Deck Generator**

Generate a valid temporary test deck for a specific card id (it considers the evolution chain of a card and the required energy types if its a pokemon card).

```bash
cargo run --bin temp_deck_generator -- "A1 035"
```

**Card Test Command**

Generate a temporary test deck and run 10,000 games against all decks in `example_decks/` (games distributed evenly) using random players.

```bash
cargo run --bin card_test -- "A1 035"
```

**Setting Up Git Hooks (Optional)**

The repository includes a pre-commit hook that ensures code quality by automatically fixing issues and running tests before each commit. To enable it:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

The pre-commit hook runs:
1. `cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty --features tui -- -D warnings` - Auto-fixes linting issues
2. `cargo fmt` - Auto-formats code
3. `git add -u` - Adds clippy and formatting fixes to the commit
4. `cargo test --features "tui test-utils"` - Runs the full test suite (fails commit if tests fail)

This helps maintain code quality and prevents broken commits, but it's optional and each developer can choose whether to enable it.

**Generating database.rs**

Ensure database.json is up-to-date with latest data. Mock the `get_card_by_enum` in `database.rs` with a `_ => panic` so that
it compiles mid-way through the generation.

```bash
cargo run --bin card_enum_generator > tmp.rs && mv tmp.rs src/card_ids.rs && cargo fmt
```

Then temporarily edit `database.rs` for `_` to match Bulbasaur (this is so that the next code can compile-run).

```bash
cargo run --bin card_enum_generator -- --database > tmp.rs && mv tmp.rs src/database.rs && cargo fmt
```

To generate attacks do (first time):
```bash
cargo run --bin card_enum_generator -- --attack-map > tmp.rs && mv tmp.rs src/actions/effect_mechanic_map.rs && cargo fmt
```

then with each new set of new mechanics, use:
```bash
cargo run --bin card_enum_generator -- --incremental-attack-map
```
and manually copy-paste into the ever changing `src/actions/effect_mechanic_map.rs`.

For abilities incremental updates, use:
```bash
cargo run --bin card_enum_generator -- --incremental-ability-map
```
and manually copy-paste into `src/actions/effect_ability_mechanic_map.rs`.

**Profiling Main Script**
sudo cargo flamegraph --root --dev -- simulate example_decks/venusaur-exeggutor.txt example_decks/weezing-arbok.txt --num 1000 && open flamegraph.svg
```
