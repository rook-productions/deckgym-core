//! Special Conditions, per the in-app Tips panel (transcribed 2026-09-08):
//!
//! - Asleep: "cannot attack or retreat. The player whose Pokémon is Asleep flips a coin during
//!   each Pokémon Checkup. If heads, the Pokémon recovers. If tails, it stays Asleep."
//! - Paralyzed: "cannot attack or retreat. After its owner's next turn, it recovers during
//!   Pokémon Checkup."
//! - Confused: "When Confused Pokémon attack, the owner must flip a coin. If heads, the attack
//!   works normally, but if tails, the attack doesn't happen and the player's turn ends."
//! - "Asleep, Paralyzed, and Confused cannot stack with each other. If one of these Special
//!   Conditions is applied, it replaces any of the others." Poisoned and Burned "can stack with
//!   other Special Conditions".
//! - "Only Active Pokémon can have Special Conditions applied to them. If an Active Pokémon
//!   returns to the Bench by retreating or some other way, it recovers from all Special
//!   Conditions." Evolving recovers from them too.
