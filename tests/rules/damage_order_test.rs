//! Official **Detailed battle FAQ**, "How do I calculate damage for Pokémon that have Weakness or
//! effects applied?" (article 57286049312665, `edited_at` 2026-05-18):
//!
//! > Follow these steps to calculate damage:
//! >
//! > 1. Start with the attack's damage.
//! > 2. Apply any effects that affect the Attacking Pokémon.
//! > 3. Apply Weakness.
//! > 4. Apply any effects that affect the Defending Pokémon.
//! >
//! > For example, when applying Weakness for a 50-damage attack against an opponent's Active
//! > Pokémon that has an effect stating "This Pokémon takes –20 damage from attacks" with the
//! > Stadium card Bounded Field in play, the opponent's Active Pokémon takes 80 damage.
//! > 50 × 2 – 20 = 80
//!
//! So Weakness sits **between** the two sides: attacker-side boosts (Giovanni, Red, the
//! attacker's own Abilities and Tools, Stadium attack bonuses) are already in the number that
//! Weakness multiplies, while every defender-side effect (Blue, "takes −N damage" effects,
//! damage-reducing Tools like Heavy Helmet and Steel Apron) is subtracted afterwards. Damage is
//! floored at 0 only at the very end, never before the Weakness step.
